# L5.2 - Arrays in practice
## Array lengths
All arrays are objects of the built-in `Array` class. The array class provides a few basic funcationalities. One of those is the `public` variable `length`.

The length of an array is very useful if one wants to loop over the entirety of an array. Let's create a for-loop that fills the newly created `alphabet` array with its proper characters!

![alphabetLoop](/assets/lecture_5/alphabetLoop.png)

Cool! Let's go through the contents of this statement, to also re-cap a bit on for loops. Don't worry if it feels complex, take your time, and divide it all into segments.

First, we create a varaible `character` to use as our values we want to insert into the `alphabet` array. Next, we create a for-loop. To initialize the loop, we assign an integer variable called `element`, and give it the value 0. This is where our array starts, at element number `0`. Then, we provide the stop condition for the loop, `element < alphabet.length`, essentially saying that we want the loop to go on for as long as there are elements left in `alphabet`. This would be the same as saying `element < 26`, but in a more general way. Finally, we set the loop increment to `element++`, which mean that for each iteration, we want to increase the `element` value by 1. This is to loop through all of the array's values. After the loop parameters comes the body of the loop. Here, we assign the current `element` of the array with the value of `character`. Then we increment the `character` by 1 as well using `character++`. Notice here how increment works perfectly fine for characters, just as for integers!

## copyOf and copyOfRange
It can be useful to be able to copy arrays, and such functionality is provided in the `java.util.Arrays` package, which is imported automatically in newer versions of Java, just like `System`. `copyOf()` and `copyOfRange()` can be used to create copies of existing arrays. `copyOf` takes two arguments, one for the name of the original array, and one for how many elements to copy.

![copyOf](/assets/lecture_5/copyOf.png)

Here, the first call asks for a copy of `alphabet` including the first 14 elements. We get the characters a-n, corresponding to the first 14 letters of the alphabet. The second call asks for `alphabet.length` elements, i.e. the entirety of `alphabet`. The last call asks for `alphabet.length - 10` elements, meaning "all but 10" of the elements of `alphabet`.

`copyOfRange()` is similar to `copyOf()`, but takes an extra integer argument for where to start copying.

The first call asks for the elements between 0-9 of `alphabet`. This will produce the same output as `Arrays.copyOfRange(alphabet, 9)`. The second calls for the elements between `7` and `alphabet.length - 8`, meaning the entire alphabet apart from the first and last 8 characters.

## binarySearch, sort and toString
binarySearch can be called on an array to search for a specific value and then return its index. This can be very useful in applications where arrays of e.g. Strings are used, or where one is looking for unique identifiers such as social security numbers. To perform a binarySearch, use this call (again from the `java.util.Arrays` package):

Another useful function from the `Arrays` package is `sort()`. It will sort an array in ascending order. To perform a sort, use this call:

![sort](/assets/lecture_5/sort.png)

`toString()` prints out all of the elements of an Array. It is also found in the `Arrays` package:

![toString](/assets/lecture_5/toString.png)

## Multi-dimensional arrays
You can create arrays of multiple dimensions by nesting them inside of each other. Let's say we want to create a board for tic-tac-toe (<i>sv.</i> tre-i-rad), which is a 3x3 square. 

![ticTacToe](/assets/lecture_5/ticTacToe.png)

First we create an empty class `Square`. Second, we create a new variable `board` of type `Square[][]`, which means an array within an array, of type `Square`. After that, we create the arrays themselves and say that we want both arrays to be of length `3`. This creates the 3x3 array set, which is immediately filled with `null`s. Finally, we assign a `new` `Square` object reference to the two first squares `[0][0]` and `[0][1]`. 

Note that the class `Square` here is just created as an empty class as an example. For a real game of tic-tac-toe it would need to be full of functionalities!

A multi-dimensional array does not have to be square. We tend to think that way if we are familiar with matrices from linear algebra, but its entirely possible to create e.g. a triangular array, or one where the length of every nested row is completely arbitrary. See if you can figure out what the array `triangularBoard` looks like!
