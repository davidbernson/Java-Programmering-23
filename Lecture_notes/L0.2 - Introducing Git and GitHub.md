# Git and GitHub demonstration
## What is Version Control?
Have you ever worked on some kind of document over an extended period of time, and found by the end that you have a boatload of different versions of your file, as you saved it multiple times with different names, just to assure that you could always go back to a previous version? Well, everyone working with digital files has that very same problem, and thus needs a practical way to solve it. Storing tens or hundreds of versions of the same file in a random folder on your disk is not a practical way, although we have probably all done it at some point.

## Git and GitHub
Git is a Version Control System (VCS) which keeps track of the changes in your files for you. It stores all of the changes and versions of your files, and enables you to go back to previous versions in an instant. Beyond just providing a log for your traced changes, it also enables you to work together with colleagues/friends on the same file(s). There's also a branching system, which enables you to create a separate branch of your file where you add e.g. a new functionality to test it out. Once you are sure that the new functionality is working as intended, you can merge the branch into your main branch. We will talk more about branching in Git in later courses.

A folder which is maintenanced by Git is called a <i>repository</i> or just <i>repo</i> in short. You can create repositories locally on your computer, or you can use a repository-service which keeps repositories online for you to access.

Git is a software that you download to your computer which allows you to create and manage repositories both locally and online. It was originally developed by Linus Torvalds as he was working on the source code of the Linux operating system. Git runs via the terminal using bash commands, which can be a bit confusing if you are mostly used to using software with graphical interfaces. For now, we will utilize a hosting service called GitHub instead. GitHub runs Git as an online service, while also providing tons of other features, and has become by far the most popular source code host in the world.

GitHub also provides you with a graphical interface to use instead of running Git commands in your terminal. You can also integrate your IDE with GitHub, and get all of the important Git commands immediately in your workspace. In this course, we are going to use GitHub extensively as we work with lecture notes, code alongs and exercises. The purpose of this is not only to provide you with the convenient functions that Git and GitHub enables, but just as important, to familiarize you with the Git and GitHub interface(s). Git is ubiquitous in the software development world today, and almost every job advert will look for some kind of experience in Git.

### Setting up our own GitHub account
If you are already using GitHub, you can skip this part

To create a GitHub account, go to github.com and click "Sign Up". Proceed by inputing your details, and make sure to select a free account. There's no need to use the commercial ones at this point. When GitHub is first launched, you will come to a screen where you can create your first repository. We will skip this for now. There will be more about creating and managing repositories later on in the course(s). For now, we are going to copy the course repository. That is, we are going to fork a publicly available repository, and make a clone of it on our own disk. 

### Forking the Course Repository
Since we are many students working with this course material, and we don't want changes to be made to the course code repository all the time, we are going to create our own <i>fork</i> of the course repository. Let's not bother much with what a fork is right now, but just get down right to business! Navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/davidbernson/Java-Programming-Mjuk23">course repository on GitHub</a>. In the top right corner, you will find several options (Pin, Watch/Unwatch, Fork and Star). 

![fork](/assets/demo_1/fork.png)

Press the "Fork" button, and you will come to the "Create a new fork" interface. Here, you will by default set yourself as the <i>Owner</i> of the fork, and you can select a name for your forked repository (the default is the same as the original repository). Add an optional description, and select "Copy the main branch only". Then click "Create fork". Now,you have succesfully created your own fork of the course repository!

The next step is to create a local folder for our repository, we will do this by using the "Clone Git Repository" in VSCode.

### Cloning a repository
Cloning a repository means to create a local directory on your computer that stores all of the tracked files, along with their history, etc. When you make changes to your files, you can then upload them (in Git, this is called <i>push</i>) to the online repository, thus, always making sure that your local and online repositories are up-to-date with each other. 

To clone our repository, we first need to create a folder where we want to store our repository. Choose a suitable location on your computer, and create a folder which you give a representative name. Then, in VSCode, go to "File", and click "New Window". In the new VSCode window, you will have several Start options, one of the being <i>Clone Git Repository</i>. Click this button, and you will get a prompt on the top of your screen. Paste the URL to your newly forked repository on GitHub, and voila! We have cloned our first repository. You will also be asked whether you trust the creator(s) of the repo, remember, a repository could contain basically anything, so make sure you know the source of the repo you're cloning.

You might need to provide your GitHub login credentials to VSCode in order for this to work.

If you now navigate to your repository folder on your computer file explorer, you will notice that your newly created folder has been filled with all of the files from the course repository! This folder also contains a subfolder named <i>.git</i>. This is where all the magic happens, and where all the information about your traced changes, branches, etc. are stored.

## Git commands and the terminal interface
There are a lot of commands that you can use in Git in order to keep track of your files, repositories and their branches. For now, we will keep it simple and focus on staging, committing and pushing. Many people prefer to use Git from the terminal prompt using command-line prompts. Many of you will likely be doing so relatively soon, and some perhaps will already prefer this method. However, the easiest way to get started using Git is to do so using your IDE as an interface. For our first explorations into Git, we will be using the integrated Git tools in VSCode. Now, let's talk about staging and committing changes.

### Stage and Commit
Committing a file to your repository means adding a file to your repository, and then telling Git to keep track of a file. You can always store files in your Git repository folder which are not tracked by Git. You can even build filters for what kinds of files that you want Git to track. Let's create a new file called MyFirstFile.txt, and add it to the main folder of our repository. In the project explorer, next to your project headline, click <i>New File</i> and name it `MyFirstFile.txt`. Don't write anything in the file yet. Now, if you go to the Source Control section (top left hand corner), you will see that VSCode keeps track of what has changed in your repository. 

![source_control](/assets/demo_1/source_control.png)

Your new file will be listed as a change, and a green 'U' symbol next to it will indicated that it is currently untracked. Select your text file, and press the '+' button next to it. This will <i>stage</i> your change(s) for committing, you will notice how the file moves into a "Staged Changes" category. Once you have staged all changes that you want to commit (for now it's just this single file), enter a message for your commit above. This message will be kept along with your trace so that you can always see what this particular commit was about. Typically, commit messages should be short and to the point, e.g. "added area calculator", or "condensed section on Git". Think of it as an e-mail topic - it should be short and precise enough for you to quickly understand what this particular commit was about! For now, just enter "This is my first commit!" as your message. Once you're done, click <i>Commit</i> and your file will now be updated in your local repository. Great, you've made your first commit using Git! 

### Push
Committing a file means committing any changes you've made into a new local version of the file. Eventually, you will want to make sure that all of your local changes are also made to your online GitHub repository. This is done using the <i>Push</i> command. When you push changes, you tell GitHub to update the online repository with your current local version of the repo, including all of your currently committed changes. If you are working in any kind of organised project, it is common to have restriction on who can push changes to the main repository, and how such pushes are made. Often, for a push to be allowed on the repository, it has to go through code review, which means that a colleague reviews the code to check it for any potential errors. This kind of code review is actually a perfect example of software testing!

Let's push the changes we just committed (our MyFirstFile.txt file) by clicking the triple dot menu on the top of the source control window, and selecting <i>Push</i>. Note that there is also a "Syncronize. Syncronize will Push your committed files to your remote repo, and also pull any new commits from your remote repo to your local repo. Now, let's navigate to our repository on GitHub.com and verify that our new `MyFirstFile.txt` file actually got uploaded to our online repo.

Voila! You have pushed your first local change to your online GitHub repository! GitHub has a ton of functionalities relating to how commits are stored and handled. You can e.g. access exactly the details of every single commit in your project. You can revert single commits, or go back in history and retreive your repository as it existed a the time of a certain commit. You can also comment and review on individual commits. This is very useful when multiple users are working on the same repository. In practice, several developers are often committing to the same repository, and employing some kind of review-and-comment system in order to proof-read each others' code. This is software testing in practice using GitHub!
