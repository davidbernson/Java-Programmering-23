# Codealong 2.2 - Taking input via Scanner

Taking input from the user can be crucial for many applications. It is going to be especially important in many of the exercises, and in both projects in this course. To facilitate an easy way of taking keyboard input via the terminal, we are going to use the `Scanner` class.

### Importing
First, we need to import the `Scanner` class to our program. We do that by adding an import statement at the top of our program: `import java.util.Scanner;`.

### Creating a Scanner object
Then, in order to use Scanner, we need to create a Scanner object which reads input from the keyboard: `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);`. Using this object, we can take input from the user and store in variable in our program.

### Reading Simple Data Types
The Scanner object has different methods for different kinds of input types. There are input-methods for all of the primitive data types, e.g. `nextInt()`, or `nextDouble()`. 

We use the Scanner object to read a value and then immediately assign it to a variable:

![nextInt](/assets/codealong_2/nextInt.png)

See how the execution stops after we assign `s.nextInt()` to our variable `myInteger`. Then, when we enter an integer (in this case 8), the assignment executes. Entering the wrong datatype for the expected input type will yield an error (InputMismatchException).

### Reading Strings 
Strings can be read either as single tokens (words) using `next()`, or by reading an entire line using `nextLine()`.

### Validating input
A good way to escape invalid inputs is to include an input validator before you use your scanner:

```
if (scanner.hasNextInt()) {
    int num = scanner.nextInt();
    // Use num
} else {
    System.out.println("Invalid input");
}
```
This way, if the next input in the input stream is not an integer, instead of producing a critical exception, the program will simply print out a message "Invalid Input" and continue with the rest of the program.

### Closing the Scanner
Always close the Scanner object after using it to avoid unnecessary memory leaks using the `.close()` method:
