# Lecture 1.5 Operators
## Operators
Operators are functionalities that assist in combinining expressions with each other. Some of the most basic operators will no doubtedly be familiar to you already, e.g. the addition operator `+` or the subtraction operator `-`. For a full list And documentation of Java operators, please refer to the <a href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/operators.html>Oracle Java documentation</a>.

Here is a list of some of the most common operators. 

| Precedence | Operator | Description |
| :---: | :----------------------: | :----------------------: | 
| 1 | ++, -- | Increment, Decrement |
| 1 | ! | Logical complement |
| 2 | * , / , %| Multiplication, Division, Remainder |
| 3 | + , - | Addition, Subtraction |
| 3 | + | String concatenation |
| 5 | instanceof | Type comparison |
| 6 | ==, != | Equality, Inqeuality |
| 7 | & | Boolean AND |
| 8 | ^ | Boolean XOR |
| 9 | \| | Boolean OR |
| 13 | = | Assignment |

It is a good idea to take some time in jshell to try out the various operators and get used to how they work, and which takes precedence over which. All of the mathematical ones work exactly like in pen and paper mathematics, i.e. multiplication is evaluated before addition, unless one part of the expression is in parentheses.

### Unary operators
The unary operators operate on a single operand, i.e. they interact with just a single variable. The most useful ones are `++` and `--`, which are incremental operators. `++` advances an integer variable one step. If the variable `number` is equal to 4, then `number++;` will advance number to 5. `--` is identical to `++` but decreases the value isntead.

The increment/decrement operators can be applied before (prefix) or after (postfix) the operand. The code `result++`; and `++result`; will both end in result being incremented by one. The only difference is that the prefix version (++result) evaluates to the incremented value, whereas the postfix version (result++) evaluates to the original value. If you are just performing a simple increment/decrement, it doesn't really matter which version you choose. But if you use this operator in part of a larger expression, the one that you choose may make a significant difference.

### Boolean operators
Boolean operators are important binary concepts in any programming language. Named after the British mathematician George Boole. Boolean operators evaluate <i>truth statements</i>, and always result in either `true` or `false`. Generally, they compare two statements according to some logical condition. For example, the `>` (greater than) compares two values, and if the left-hand one is greater than the right-hand one, the boolean evaluates to `true`. The same holds for `<` (lesser than), just the other way around. The classic memory rule for `>` and `<` is to think of them as crocodile mouths. The crocodile is hungry, and as such, it always opens its mouth towards the greater value. `<` and `>` are exclusive, meaning that for `a < b`, if `a` and `b` are both equal to 6, then `a < b` evaluates to `false`. To make an inclusive comparison of two values, we use the `>=` and `<=` operators instead. They read out literally as <i>greater than or equal to</i>, and conversely, <i>lesser than or equal to</i>. In our above example, `a <= b` would evaluate to `true`.

It is noteworthy that these operators work not only with numbers, but also with e.g. characters. `'a' < 'b'` will evaluate to true! This is because `'b'` comes after `'a'` in the alphabet. Or more technically, since the number that encodes the `'a'` is lower than the one encoding `'b'`.

When first starting out with programming, it is a good idea to become friends with some of the most common boolean operators, as they are very commonly used to control flow of code. Here is a table of the most commonly occuring ones:

| Operator | Description | Example |
| :---: | :-----------------------: | :---------: |
| `==` (equal to) | Checks if the values of two operands are equal or not, if yes, then evaluates to true. | (`'A' == 'B')`) evaluates to `false`. |
| `!=` (not equal to) | Checks if the values of two operands are inequal, if yes, evaluates to true. | (`'A' != 'B'`) evaluates to `true`. |
| `>` (greater than) | Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than that of the right operand. If yes, evaluates to `true`. | `(4 > 8)` evaluates to `false`. |
| `<` (less than) | Checks if the value of the left operand is less than that of the right operand. If yes, evaluates to `true`. | `(4 < 8)` evaluates to `true`. |
| `>=` (greater than or equal to) | Checks if the value of the left operand is greater to or equal to that of the right operand. If yes, evaluate to `true`. | `('C' >= 'B')` evaluates to `false`. | 
| `<=` (less than or equal to) | Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to that of the right operand. If yes, evaluate to `true`. | `('C' <= 'B')` evaluates to `false`. |
| `&&` (logical AND) | Checks if both operands are `true`. If yes, evaluates to true. | `(4 > 3) && (6 > 4)` evaluates to `true`. |
| `\|\|` (logical OR) | Checks if any of the two operands are `true`. If yes, evaluates to true. | `('C' < 'B'> \|\| 4 <= 8)` evaluates to `true`. |
| `!` (logical NOT) | Evaluates to the reverse logical statement of its operand. | `!(4 > 6)` evaluates to `true`. |

### The dot operator
A special operator is the dot (`.`) operator. It is used to retreive local variables and methods from inside of classes or objects. We used the dot operator when we retreived the constant `CENTER` from the `JLabel` object that we created in the `HelloJava` program: `JLabel.CENTER`. We also used the dot operator when we used e.g. the `setVisible()` method on our `frame` object: `frame.setVisible(true);`. The dot operator can be used in sequence to apply further methods to the result of the initial evaluation. Let's create a simple example in jshell:

Here we have applied three methods on our old `paulie` parrot variable using the dot operator. First, we call on `getClass()` to print the class name. Then, we immediately push that result into `getSimpleName()`, which gives us the class name as a String result. Finally, we call on `length()`, to get the length of the String. In the following rows, we have gradually removed the different functions to see each intermediary result. This kind of sequential use of the dot operator is called <i>chaining</i> method calls. We have actually already done that in our original `HelloWorld` program when we called on `System.out.println()` to print our message to the terminal. In that case we call on `println()` to operate on the `out` variable that exists in the `System` class.
