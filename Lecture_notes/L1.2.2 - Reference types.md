## Reference types
Java is an object-oriented language, meaning that complex data types can be constructed from the primitive types by creating <i>classes</i>. Every time we create a new class in Java, we are also creating a new data-type of the same name. Let's imagine that we have created a class named `Parrot`. This also means that we are creating a data-type `Parrot`. Just like primitive types, an object of type `Parrot`, can be assigned to variable of type `Parrot`. The data-type `Parrot` describes what kinds of operations and functions that can be used on our `Parrot` object.

### Polymorphism
In order to talk about reference types we also need to expand a little bit on classes. There will be much more on classer a little bit lateron.

Classes and data-types have relationships to each other. In our simple example, we may have another class `Bird` that serves as a parent-class for `Parrot`. `Parrot` in this case is a specialized version of `Bird`. Perhaps `Parrot` has some additional functionality relating to only parrots but not other birds. We might for example add a function called `speak()` to our `Parrot` class, because we all know parrots can talk, right! In this case, `Parrot` is a <i>sub-class</i> to `Bird`. Another way of describing it is that `Parrot` <i>extends</i> `Bird`.

The same kind of parent-child relationship exists between data types. The `Parrot` datatype will be a subtype of `Bird`. What this practically means, is that a `Parrot` object can always be assigned to a `Bird` variable, but not the other way around. It all makes logical sense, a parrot is always a bird, but not all birds are parrots. The fact that a subtype can always be assigned to a variable of its parent type is called <i>subtype polymorphism</i>. Java has a lot of functionalities (which we will touch more on later) regarding subtyping and subclasses in order to promote polymorphism, i.e. that objects can be recognized as belonging to multiple types.

### References
An important concept for reference types is that they are always assigned as <i>references</i>. This is different from the primitive types, which are assigned by <i>value</i>. When we copy the value of a primitive variable (for example an `int`), its value is copied to the new instance. The receiving end receives a copy of the specific value. For reference type variables, instead of storing actual values, they store <i>references</i> or <i>pointers</i> that point to a certain object. This will sound a bit unclear right now, but what it means is that if you pass a reference type variable, what you are passing is not the the referenced object itself, but <b>just the <i>reference</i></b>. Let's write a bit of code to get a practical example! 

First of all, let's create an empty class called `Parrot`, just to use as an example.

Next, we declare a variable of type `Parrot`, and then construct a new `Parrot` object and assign it to our newly declared variable. Here, I named my variable `paulie` just to give it a very parrot-y name.

![paulie](/assets/lecture_1/paulie.png)

We see that when we declare the variable, jshell assigns it the value `null` by default. `null` is an important concept in programming, and simply means that the variable contains no value at all. When we create the new `Parrot` object, and assign it to the variable `paulie`, jshell tells us that it has created a reference to the new object and stored it in the variable. `Parrot` means that it is a reference to a `Parrot` type object, and the sequence of characters after the @ is the pointer value. Now, if we create a second variable to hold another `Parrot` object, we will see that we get a different pointer reference. (note also that we, just as for primitive types, can declare and assign variables on the same row also for reference types).

Now. The tricky part about reference type variables, is that if we assign a variable with a reference type variable, what we assign is the reference, not the values of the object! This means that if we assign a variable with our `paulie` variable, the new variable will not be a copy of `paulie`, it will be copy of the reference that points to the same `Parrot` object (Parrot@13805618) that `paulie`is pointing to. Sounds complicated? Let's see it in action! We will create a 3rd `Parrot` variable, and name it `doris`. We will assign `doris` the value `paulie` and see what happens.

![doris](/assets/lecture_1/doris.png)

Notice how the pointer stored in the `doris` variable is exactly identical to the one stored in `paulie`. This is because they are both pointing to the same object (Parrot@13805618)! Suppose we invoke a method on one of our parrots, let's say we have a function (in Java it's actually called a <i>method</i>, more on that in a few lectures) called `gainWeight()`, that causes the parrot to gain a number of grams of weight. Don't worry about how that function works at this moment, just know that it is called by typing `paulie.gainWeight(25);`. If we do this, the `Parrot` object at which `paulie` is pointing will gain 25 grams of weight. But so will the one that `doris` points to, as they are one and the same parrot! If we on the other hand, give some food to `jones`, by typing `jones.gainWeight(25)`, nothing will happen to the `paulie`/`doris` parrot as it is a different object!

## Strings
Finally, we come to a special case, Strings. A <i>string</i> is a sequence of characters of variable length. Technically, `String` is a reference type, although it has some built-in functionalities in Java that makes it behave a little bit more like a primitive type. For example, you can concatenate (add together) two strings using the `+` operator:

![concat](/assets/lecture_1/stringConcat.png)

Also, you can use Strings as literals in e.g. function arguments. Let's go back to our `HelloWorld` program again. We used the statement `System.out.print("Hello World!");` to print our "Hello World!" message to the terminal. Here, "Hello World!" is a String variable which is provided to the function as a literal (it does not need to be declared as a String). This also works when you assign a String variable, you don't have to instantiate a `new String()` object, but can just simply do: `String myString = "ABCDEF"`

## Null
There's also a special `null` literal that can be used as a value for any reference type. null may be assigned to any variable, except variables of primitive types. There's little you can do with a null value beyond testing for its presence. Therefore, null is often used in programs as a marker to indicate that some object is unavailable.
