# Lecture 3.4 - Static methods and variables
Let's take a final look at the <i>static</i> keyword for variables and methods. A method can be declared static by addition of the `static` keyword. You will have noticed already that the `main()` method of our `HelloJava` class used the `static` keyword. A static method can be accessed and invoked from outside of its parent object. For all methods that we have discussed so far, we have first instantiated an object of a class (often our `Walrus` class), and then invoked the method upon that object. A static method does not need a declared object, but can be invoked on its own. We can create an example of a `static` method in our `Walrus` class by making a method that prints the default values of our walrus.

Here, the `makeSound()` method simply prints a sentence that describes the sound of a walrus (everyone knows the main sound of a walrus is "Burp!"). Since the method is declared as `static`, it can be accessed even though there is no current implementation of any `Walrus` objects. It is done so by accessing it directly from the `Walrus` class:

Voila! Our method is called, and produces its print, even though we have no existing `Walrus` object. Variables can also be declared static, meaning that they are accessible without instantiation of their respective class. Commonly occuring examples of static varaibles include e.g. the constants in the `Math` class, such as `Math.PI` or `Math.E`. In fact, all of the constants and methods in the `Math` class are static!

Obviously, it would be slightly annoying if we, every single time we wanted to use a mathematical constant, had to declare and initialize a `Math` object in order to use them. Instead, they are declared `static`, and thus usable from anywhere. If you try to instantiate a new object of the `Math` class, you will get an Error, since the `Math` class uses a `private` constructor, meaning that it cannot be instantiated.
