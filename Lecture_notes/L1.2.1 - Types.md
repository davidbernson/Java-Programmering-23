# Lecture 1.2 - Data Types
The data type of a variable declares what type of information we can store in it, and what operations we can do with it. An <i>integer</i> will hold single digits, a <i>char</i> will hold single characters, and a <i>boolean</i> will hold binary information of the kind (true/false) or (0/1).

In comparing different programming languages, one often talks about the <i>type system</i> of a specific language. The type system describes how data is stored in memory, and also how they relate to each other. C for example, is a <i>statically typed</i> language, where the data type is a simple and unchanging attribute of a variable. In C, data type corresponds directly to how the underlying hardware functions. Python, on the other hand, is a <i>dynamically typed</i> language, meaning that its data types can be changed throughout their life-time. While convenient, this also introduces a lot of validation when such a program is executed, contributing to the fact that Python is generally slower than C.

Java sits in an in-between spot in terms of being statically or dynamically typed. We will not go into much details on the nature on how Java handles data typing, but the take-home message here is that you must <b>always declare a data type when you declare a new variable</b>!

In the previous chapter, all the variables we declared were of type <i>integer</i>, as specified by the `int` keyword. In this chapter, we will try to declare variables of some other types, and see what operations we can make on them.

## Primitive types
Java includes a number of <i>primitive types</i> that represent simple values with all of their functionality built-in to the language itself. These include e.g. the previously mentioned integer, but also other kinds of numbers, booleans and characters. 

### Memory allocation for primitive data types
All of the primitive types are precisely defined in memory. An `int` is a 32-bit integer, meaning that it can take on values ranging from -2,100,000,000 to +2,100,000,000. A `byte` on the other hand, is an 8-bit integer, meaning that it can only take on values between -128 and +127. By using different number data types depending on the kind of data you are expecting, your programs can be significantly optimized in terms of performance. Let's say you are creating an ice-hockey application that keeps track of live scoring. The total score in a game of hockey would never realistically surpass 20 or so goals, and definitely not 127, so a `byte`-type variable would be enough to store that information, leading to more optimized performance. For the kind of small applications we will be creating in this course, these difference will likely not be very big though, so using the classic `int` for your integer variables will be perfectly fine.

### Java primitive data types
For a quick reference on the primitive Java types see the below table:

| Type |     Definition     |          Range/Precision     |     
| :---: | :----------------------: | :----------------------: | 
|  `boolean`   |        Logical value        | `true` or `false` | 
|  `char`  | 16-bit Unicode character | 64K characters | 
|  `byte`   | 8-bit signed integer | -128 to 127 | 
|  `short`   | 16-bit signed integer | -32,768 to 32,767 | 
|  `int`   | 32-bit signed integer | -2.1e9 to 2.1e9 | 
|  `long`   | 64-bit signed integer | -9.2e18 to 9.2e18 | 
|  `float`   | 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point value | 6-7 significant decimal places | 
|  `double`   | 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point value | 15 significant decimal places | 

You will notice that the two data types that can hold decimal values (`float` and `double`) provide a range of the significant decimals instead of the full range. For all intents and purposes, you can use either `float` or `double`, as for our sizes of applications, it will have a negligible influence.

If you ever need bigger numbers than the primitive classes can offer (e.g. in cryptography), there are additional higher-level classes such as `BigInt` and `BigDecimal` that offers that kind of functionality.

### More on assigning values
Let's continue on the assignment of values that we started with in the last lecture. A numeric value can only be assigned to a variable with a data type large enough to hold it. Let's create a `byte` variable `a` and assign it the value 8.

If we try to re-assign `a` with the value 800 (which is way over the limit of a `byte`-type variable) jshell will produce an error. This is because the value 800 does not fit into the memory allocated for our variable `a`. If we on the other hand declare a variable `b` as an `int`-type variable, it will work fine.

Similarly, we cannot assign the value of an `int` to a `byte` variable, but we can do it the other way around. Let's see a simple example:

![int_to_byte](/assets/lecture_1/int_to_byte.png)

![byte_to_int](/assets/lecture_1/byte_to_int.png)

### Casting to another type
Java does provide an option for assigning a variable a value from another variable-type, called <i>casting</i>. To cast a variable, enter the type you want to cast it as in parentheses before the variable name. In the below example, our previous assignment of `a` using `b` is working, because Java is casting `b` as a byte, as per our instructions. Be aware that type-casting is can be unstable, and it is easy to mistakenly implement erroneous code. It is preferrable to create variables as their correct data-types from start.
