# Lecture 2.2 - Classes - Packages and Imports

## Packages
Every class belongs to a package. Packages are a way of structuring code into manageable blocks. The package mentioned above `java.lang` is the core package of Java, including all of the fundamental classes. All of the classes associated with the graphical interface that Java can create, the one we used in our `HelloJava` program, are bundled in the `javax.swing` package. The base class in `javax.swing` is called `JComponent`, and both `JLabel` and `JFrame` are extended from `JComponent`. `JComponent` itself, of course, traces its origins back to the `Object` class in the `java.lang` package. This means that classes must have access to classes that belong to other packages. This is handled via <i>imports</i>. More on imports in a short while.

You can bundle your own classes into packages as well! Just include a code segment `package {name}` at the top of your `.java` source file. Below is the source code for the `JLabel` class:

The line `package javax.swing` signifies that `JLabel` belongs to the `javax.swing` package, just like we mentioned earlier! If I am creating a Zoo application, and have coded up a class for a parrot, I might include it in a package like: `package zoo.animals`. The `.` operator here signifies a subpackage, which is just a way of providing further refinement to your packages. `animals` is a package inside of the `zoo` package where I can bundle all of my animal classes, such as `Parrot` or `Walrus`. Using a clever naming convention for packages helps a lot when you want to import a class into a new class!

## Imports
One great aspect of working in a well-defined, established programming language (like Java!) is that likely, someone has already solved your problem. And unless you are a very experienced programmer, their solution is likely also more efficient. Herein lies the strength of imports. Using the keyword `import`, you can import any package of classes directly into your own class! If you e.g. want to establish a WiFi connection, there's a package that does exactly that (`javax.microedition.io.AccessPoint`). To import this package, simply add `import javax.microedition.io.AccessPoint` to the beginning of your sorce code file.

You can import either a single class, using the afore-mentioned code, or you can import an entire package, by using `*` instead. We did exactly this when we imported the `javax.swing` package in our `HelloJava` program. At the top of our source file, we wrote `import javax.swing.*`, signalling that we want to import all classes that reside in the `javax.swing` package. In this case, since we only used two classes, `JFrame` and `JLabel`, we could also have just written:
```
import javax.swing.JFrame;
import javax.swing.JLabel;
```
This import, while including more code, is much more clear to the reader of the code. If you on the other hand intend to be creating a large graphical interface, and you want to use many of the classes in swing, then a package-wide import is more suitable.

You can actually use classes from packages without importing them initially as well. Just include the entire package-label to your class when you call on it.
```
javax.swing.JFrame frame = new javax.swing.JFrame("Hello, Java!");
```
This takes up a lot of space in your code, and often just overcomplicates things. Although there are certainly times when this kind of import might be keeping your code cleaner and more concise.
