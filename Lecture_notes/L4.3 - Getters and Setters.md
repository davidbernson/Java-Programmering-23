# Lecture 2.6 - Classes - Getters and Setters
We have already seen how we can change fields of a class instance by assigning them using the dot operator (recall lecture 2.5 when we changed the name of our walrus object to Thelonius). However, we have also seen how we can not change the value of a field if it is not set to `public`. As touched upon earlier, the convention in Java programming is to keep all fields within a class as `private` rather than `public`, to avoid assigning them values by mistake. So how then do I assign value to a `private` field if I really do want to change it? For example, what if I want to change the name of our `roxanne` walrus obect to actually be "Roxanne"? Or what if I want to read the name of the `roxanne` walrus object? Well, we can design methods for that! Since methods exist within a class, they also have access to all of the `private` variable of that class. This means that we can use a method that "gets" the value of a private variable in order to retreive its value from the outside. Let's define such a method:

![getName](/assets/lecture_2/getName.PNG)

Here, we defined a method that returns a String type object, that takes no input arguments. It will return the value of the `name` field of our walrus object. By invoking this method, we will "get" the value of `name`, therefore, it is called a "getter" method. A getter is almost always named `getX()`, where `X` is the field that is retreived. 

Similarly, there is a standard "setter" method that can be used to set the value of a `private` field. Let's see an example for our `name` field:

![setName](/assets/lecture_2/setName.PNG)

In a similar way to our getter, the setter provides access to a `private` field, in this case the `name` field. Conversely to the getter, the setter has an input argument, where the new value for the field is provided. Here, it is again important the the types of the argument and the field are compliant with each other. The body of the method consists of just `this.name = name;`. `this` is a special keyword that refers to the <i>current object</i>. In our example, if we invoke the `setName()` method on our `abraham` object by calling `abraham.setName("Thelonius")`, `this.name` means that we are referring to the name stored in `abraham`, not the name provided as the input argument (remember, both these variables are called `name`.) This might be a little confusing, but it will clarify later on once we get to use the `this` keyword more. For now, just remember that a setter takes an input argument, and changes a field of object that it is invoked upon.

Since the convention in Java is to keep class fields `private`, these kinds of getter/setter methods are extremely common in Java classes. In fact, they're so common that many IDEs will automatically create them for you with the simple click of a button! In VSCode, if you position your input indicator on a row where it applies, a small yellow lightbulb will appear to the left. 

![lightbulb](/assets/lecture_2/lightbulb.PNG)

If you click this lightbulb, VSCode will provide a number of suggestions of things that you might be interested in doing in your code. If you position your input indicator on a line with a declared field, you will see (among other things) "Generate Getter and Setter for `X`".
 
![generateGetSet](/assets/lecture_2/generateGetSet.png) 
  
If you click this button, VSCode will automatically produces getters and setters for that variable, following the naming conventions discussed above. Convenient! This displays the power of using an IDE instead of a normal text editor.
