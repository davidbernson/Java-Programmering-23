# L5.3 - Enum
Enum is short for <i>enumerated type</i> and is a special class that can store a set of pre-defined constants. Enums are very useful when you have a list of constants that you need to use through your application, and know that these will not change. Some examples include the days of the week, the compass directions, or the planets of our solar system. By convention, since the items in an enum are constants, they are declared with CAPITAL LETTERS.

To declare an enum, simply type:
```
public enum Directions {
    NORTH,
    EAST,
    SOUTH,
    WEST;
} 
```

Often, enums are stored in their own separate java files. Once they are defined, they usually are just kept as they are for use.

## Looping over an enum
An Enum has some useful features, one of them being that you can loop over them using the enhanced for-loop. Using the `.values()` method, you can obtain an Array that contains the values of your enum, and then use that in your loop declaration. The following loop will loop over all items in the `Directions` enum, and print their value to the terminal.

```
for (Directions d : Directions.values()) {
    System.out.println(d);
}
```
