# Lecture 1.5 - Control Flow
## Code blocks
Before we start delving into the various elements that can be used to control the flow of code execution (conditions, loops, etc) we need to introduce the concept of <i>code blocks</i>. You have seen code blocks in action already in our initial `HelloWorld` program, but you might not have noticed them. A code block is a segment of code that is encapsulated within a pair of curly braces (`{}`), and contains statements such as expressions and declarations. Let's see an example:
```
{
    int length = 6;
    String color = "blue";
    // Any number of following statements
}
```
We have touched upon methods in earlier lectures. A method is essentially a code block that has been given a name, just like a variable is a memory allocation that has been given a name. Our previous example might be a method used to create a ribbon:
```
createRibbon(String color) {
    int length = 6;
    String ribbonColor = color;
    // More ribbon-creation statements
} 
```
An important concept about code blocks is how they use variables. We say that variables in the Java programming language are <i>scoped</i>, meaning that they are visible only within their respective code block. If a variable is declared inside a code block, it cannot be seen or used outside of the block. Here's a simple example:

![scope](/assets/lecture_1/scope.png)

See how the variable that is declared inside a code block cannot be assigned outside of the code block! There are ways around this, for example by creating variables inside of public classes, but we will talk more about that when we come to visibility modifiers. For now, the take-home message is that code blocks are like Vegas; what happens in a code block, stays in the code block!

## Control Flow statements
Control flow statements do just what they sounds like they do; they control the flow of code execution. Control flow statements is (together with classes and methods) the most common usage of code blocks. Here, the code block is used to define a series of statements that are to be executed upon certain conditions, or in a certain number of iterations (loops). Let's start with one of the most commonly used conditional control flow statements, the <i>if/else condition</i>.

### If/Else
A large part of software exectuion is about decision making. The software might come to a situation where it needs to check whether something has happened, or if the software is in a certain state. "If the temperature is above 20°C..." or "If battery power is below 15%...", then do something. For these kind of conditional statements, almost all programming languages, including Java, implements the <i>if/else</i> statement. In its simplest form, it consists of an if-condition, followed by a statement, and then an else followed by another statement:
```
if (condition)
    statement1;
else
    statement2;

// Alternatively, on a single line

if (condition) statement1; else statement2;
```
What it means is that if the condition is evaluated to `true`, then statement1 is executed, if it evaluates to `false`, then statement2 is executed. The condition is a <i>boolean expression</i>, meaning that it has two possible outcomes, `true` or `false`. In the most simplistic case, the condition is set to `true`, but more typical is that some kind of expression that evaluates to `true/false` is used. As both statement1 and statement2 are statements, they can be series of statements encapsulated within curly braces:
```
int customerId = 32;

if (customerId < 45) {
    System.out.println("This customer is an early adopter!");
    customer.setDiscount(15);
} else {
    System.out.println("This customer is late to the party...");
    customer.setDiscount(0);
}
```

### If/Else-if/Else
A special case of the if/else conditional statement is the <i>if/else-if/else></i> statement. It works in exactly the same way as the aforementioned if/else statement, but introduces an intermediate condition called the else-if. If the orginal if-condition evaluates to false, then the else-if condition will be evaluated in the same way. Logically, if it also evaluates to false, execution will proceed to the else statement:
```
if (condition)
    statement1;
else if (condition)
    statement2;
else
    statement3;
```
You can chain together an infinite number of else if conditional statements if there are multiple conditions that you want to evaluate. However, it can lead to messy code relatively quickly, so there is probably a better way of doing it. Such as... *drum-roll*

### Switch statement
A <i>switch statement</i> (also referred to as a case statement) is a statement that takes a conditon that evaluates to either integer or String type, evaluates it, and depending on the result, directs code execution to one of many statements (cases). A typical use-case is if you have some kind of multiple-choice option for a user on how to proceed. You let the chosen answer be encoded as a String or an integer, and then use a switch statement to determine what statements are executed:
```
int chosenMethod = 3;

switch (chosenMethod) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("You chose option 1!");
    case 2:
        System.out.println("You chose option 2!");
    case 3:
        System.out.println("You chose option 3!");
}
```
