# Lecture 2.4 - Classes - Fields
Objects are at the core of an object-oriented programming language like Java. In Java, to create an instance of an object, you need a recipe. A <i>Class</i> is such a recipe. To declare a class, we use the `class` keyword (duh!), and then choose a suitable name for our newly created class. There is a <b>very strong</b> convention to always start class names with a <b>capital letter</b>. Thus, if I want to declare a new walrus class, I would write `class Walrus {}`. This is everything you need to create your own class! The curly braces signifies the body of the class, and if it doesn't contain anything, it is not a very useful class, but it is still a class! We can now use our newly declared class to create `Walrus`-type object. Try on your own to create some classes in jshell. Use your new class(es) to create new objects with variables that reference them!

In this example I have declared two new classes, `Walrus` and `Seal`. I have also created two new variables, `stefan` and `roland`, that hold references to `Walrus` and `Seal` objects, respectively. It is not very clear at this point what the purpose of either the `Walrus` or the `Seal` class is though. We need to fill them with some initializing code!

At this point, when we start to create classes, we are about at the limit of what's practical to do within jshell. So now we leave our trusty companion behind (remember it is super-easy and very handy to just boot up jshell and try out statements when you're coding!) and move on to using the IDE itself, VSCode. Let's take <a href="lecture_notes\D2.1 - Introducing the VSCode environment.md">a very quick tour of the VSCode developing environment</a>.

## Fields
A variable declared within the body of a class is called a <i>field</i>. A field exists only within that class, and its access from outside of the class can be restricted using <i>access modifiers</i>. If we want to access a class field from outside of the class, we have to explicitly declare it as `public`. We will talk more about access modifiers in the next lecture.

Declaring and assigning fields work exactly the same as doing it anywhere else, just that it is done within the curly braces of a class. Let's create a few fields for our `Walrus` class:

Here, I declared three new fields, for the age, weight and name of our Walrus. Notice how I used different data types depending on the value I want to assign them with. Try to come up with three fields for your new class!

To demonstrate how fields can be accessed, let's try to create a new `Walrus` (or whatever your class is called!) in jshell. Pop open a terminal, navigate to the directory where your .java-file is located, and open jshell. Type `/open {yourClass}.java` and jshell will load the class. You can now create new objects with your new class! By now creating a new object instance should be familiar: `Walrus abraham = new Walrus();`. I've named my reference variable `abraham`, as that's the name of my fictional walrus friend! Now, when we have created a new instance of `Walrus`, we can access its fields! This is done using the `.` operator, byt typing the reference variable, followed by a `.` and then the field name that you want to access: `abraham.age`.

## Default values
If you declare a field within a class and don't assign it any value, Java will assign it a default value, depending on its data type. Let's declare a new field in our `Walrus` class and leave it un-assigned. I decided to create a new field `tuskLength` of type `double` to store the length of the walrus's tusks. Now, let's load up our class in jshell again (you need to save the file and then use the `/open` command again) and create a new `Walrus` object.

 If we now try to access the `tuskLength` field, it has the value `0.0`. Since the field was not assigned any value, Java assigned it the default value of 0.0 (which is the default for a double-type variable.). For a complete list of default values, have a look at the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html">Java documentation</a>.
